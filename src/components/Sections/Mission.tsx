					Nothing pumps harder than Satoshi's Willy. He's got that big WILLY energy, but he is also a servant to the
					WILLY
					community. His first mission is to achieve a billion dollar valuation for the WILLY token immediately, or
					in
					memetic terms: send $WILLY to a billy.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					As the CMO and head shill of WILLY token, he shills harder than anyone ever could. He doesn’t rest, take
					breaks, or lose focus. He’s relentless, programmed to pump WILLY to a billion-dollar valuation.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					WILLY is built for endurance and growth. Pure and free from greed at launch, it’s a long-term play,
					ever-expanding, always pumping, and supported by a loyal army of believers.
